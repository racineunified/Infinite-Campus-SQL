# Infinite-Campus-SQL

This is a repository of SQL (SQL Server) scripts for Infinite Campus. The idea here is that it's not an efficient use of resources for school districts to re-invent the wheel for common or shared functionality. K12 school districts are encouraged to share!  Infinite Campus also has a forum dedicated to Reporting and Analysis which can be found here: https://community.infinitecampus.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?5-Reporting-and-Analysis

DISCLAIMER: Any script you find you use at your own risk.
